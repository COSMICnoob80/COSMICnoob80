Welcome to the "Smart Wallet" project! This endeavor is the result of my exploration into blockchain development, aimed at building practical skills and understanding advanced concepts within Solidity.
Within this repository, you'll find a deep dive into data structures such as mappings and structs, alongside insights into exception handling techniques specific to Solidity. Through hands-on experimentation and learning, I've crafted a functional wallet application that showcases the practical application of these concepts.
Join me on this journey of discovery as we navigate the complexities of blockchain development and tackle real-world challenges. Together, let's delve into the world of "Smart Wallet" and unlock the potential of blockchain technology.
